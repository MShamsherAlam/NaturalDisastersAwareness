Section 1 ----->     To propose a change to the master branch on git hub

                1. Make sure you are uptodate with the origin master on bitbucket.
                2. Create a new branch from the parent master branch on your local machine.
                3. Name the branch according to its purpose. (refer Q&A for example)
                4. Checkout the newly made branch.
                5. Now make the changes in the code that you want to propose or add to the master branch on origin.
                6. Once you have made appropriate changes push the changes to the origin.
                7. Make sure you are pushing the "newly made branch" to the origin and "NOT pushing the master branch".
                8. Once you push the branch to origin, you can now make a pull request (refer to Section 2).
                9. Now the origin owner will view your proposal and decide whether to put or need further changes.
                10.The owner will notify you with whatever changes need to be made or he can accept the pull request.
                11.Once the changes are made the branch maybe deleted. (view Q&A for queries)
